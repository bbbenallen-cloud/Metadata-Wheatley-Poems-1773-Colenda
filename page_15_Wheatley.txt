To the PUBLICK.

AS it has been repeatedly suggested to the Publisher, by Per–
sons, who have seen the Manuscript, that Numbers
would be ready to suspect they were not really the Writings of
PHILLIS, he has procured the following Attestation, from
the most respectable Characters in Boston, that none might have
the least Ground for disputing their Original,

WE whose Names are under-written, do assure the World,
that the POEMS specified in the following Page, * were (as we
verily believe) written by PHILLIS, a young Negro Girl, who
was but a few Years since, brought an uncultivated Barbarian
from Africa, and has ever since been, and now is, under the
Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in this Town.
She has been examined by some of the best Judges, and is
thought qualified to write them.
