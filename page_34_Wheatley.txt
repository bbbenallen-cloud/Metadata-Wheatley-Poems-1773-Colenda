26 POEMS ON

"Wilt thou be prais’d? Seraphic pow’rs are faint
"Infinite love and majesty to paint.
"To thee let all their grateful voices raise,
"And faints and angels join their songs of
“praise.” 20

Perfect in bliss she from her heav’nly home
Looks down, and smiling beckons you to come;
Why then, fond parents, why these fruitless groans?
Restrain your tears, and cease your plaintive moans.
Freed from a world of sin, and snares, and pain, 25
Why would you wish your daughter back again?
No—bow resign’d. Let hope your grief control,
And check the rising tumult of the soul.
Calm in the prosperous, and adverse day,
Adore the God who gives and takes away; 30
Eye him in all, his holy name revere,
Upright your actions, and your hearts sincere,
Till having fail’d through life’s tempestuous sea,
And from its rocks, and boist’rous billows free,
Yourselves, safe landed on the blissful shore, 35
Shall join your happy babe to part no more.
