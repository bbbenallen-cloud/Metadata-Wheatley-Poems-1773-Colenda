VARTOUS SUBIECTS. 17

TO the KING'S Most Excellent Majesty.
1768.

YOUR subjects hope, dread Sire—
The crown upon your brows may flourish
long,
And that your arm may in your God be strong!
O may your sceptre num’rous nations sway,
And all with love and readiness obey!

But how shall we the British king reward! 5
Rule thou in peace, our father, and our lord!
Midst the remembrance of thy favours past,
The meanest peasants most admire the last. *
May George, belov’d by all the nations round,
Live with heav’ns choicest constant blessings
crown’d! 10
Great God, direct, and guard him from on high,
And from his head let ev’ry evil fly !
And may each clime with equal gladness see
A monarch’s smile can set his subjects free!
