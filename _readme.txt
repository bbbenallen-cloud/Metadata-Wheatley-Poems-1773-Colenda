I chose to record data about voice and hierarchy in this Wheatley excerpt. First, I was interested in how much of what she is writing is “authentic” to what she might really want to write, publish, or think, or if this book is more the coalescence and result of the hegemonies imposed upon her and her language. I know this question of voice can be ambiguous, so I decided to see if it was quantifiable. I measured the speaker, addressees, and pronouns (who are the subjects and objects); I measured the predicate grammar on assertiveness or permissiveness (how these subjects interrelate); and I measured many hegemonic words (nation, slavery, race, gender, religion, history). These descriptive metadata are the first step in my investigation as I try to comb through this piece on a high level: what is Wheatley talking about, how is she talking about it, and what speculations about her language and its imposed limits can we begin to make?
