On the Death of the Rev. Dr. SEWELL.
1769.

ERE yet the morn its lovely blushes spread,
See Sewell number’d with the happy dead,
Hail, holy man, arriv’d th’ immortal shore;
Though we shall hear thy warning voice no mote.
Come, let us all behold with wishful eyes 5
The saint ascending to his native skies;
From hence the prophet wing’d his rapt’rous way
To the blest mansions in eternal day:
Then begging for the Spirit of our God,
And panting eager for the same abode; 10
Come, let us all with the same vigour rise,
And take a prospect of the blissful skies;
While on our minds Christ’s image is imprest,
And the dear Saviour glows in ev’ry breast.
Thrice happy saint! to find thy heav’n at last, 15
What compensation for the evils past!
