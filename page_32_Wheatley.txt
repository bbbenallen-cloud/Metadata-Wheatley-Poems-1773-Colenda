24 POEMS ON

Great Countess, * we Americans revere
Thy name, and mingle in thy grief sincere;
New England deeply feels, the Orphans mourn, 40
Their more than father will no more return.

But, though arrested by the hand of death,
Whitefield no more exerts his lab’ring breath,
Yet let us view him in th’ eternal skies,
Let ev’ry heart to this bright vision rise;
While the tomb safe retains its sacred trust,
Till life divine re-animates his dust,

*The Countess of Huntingdon, to whom Mr. Whitefield
was Chaplain.
