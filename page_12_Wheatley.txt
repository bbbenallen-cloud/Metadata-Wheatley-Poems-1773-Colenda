PREFACE.

THE following Poems were
written originally for the
Amusement of the Author, as they
were the Produ√©ts of her leisure Mo-
ments. She had no Intention ever
to have published them; nor would
they now have made their Appear-
ance, but at the Importunity of
many of her best, and most gene-
rous Friends; to whom she con-
fiders herself, as under the greatest
Obligations.

As her Attempts in Poetry are
now sent into the World, it is
hoped the Critic will not severely
censure their Defects; and we pre-
sume they have too much Merit
