The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the
Author's Master to the Publisher.

PHILLIS was brought from Africa to America,
in the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight
Years of Age. Without any Assistance from School
Education, and by only what she was taught in the
Family, she, in sixteen Months Time from her Ar-
rival, attained the English Language, to which she
was an utter Stranger before, to such a Degree, as
to read any, the most difficult Parts of the Sacred
Writings, to the greast Astonishment of all who
heard her.

As to her WRITING, her own Curiosity led her
to it; and this she learnt in so short a Time, that in
the Year 1765, she wrote a Letter to the Rev.
Mr. OCCOM, the Indian Minister, while in England.

She has a great inclination to learn the Latin
Tongue, and has made some Progress in it. This
Relation is given by her Master who bought her,
and with whom she now lives;

JOHN WHEATLEY.

Boston, Nov. 14, 1772.
