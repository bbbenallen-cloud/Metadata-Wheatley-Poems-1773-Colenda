VARIOUS SUBJECTS. 23

Thou moon hast seen, and all the stars of light,
How he has wrestled with his God by night,
He pray’d; shat grace in ev’ry heart might dwell, 20
He long’d to see America excel;

He charg’d its youth that ev’ry grace divine
Should with full lustre in their conduct shine;
That Saviour, which his foul did first receive,
The greatest gift that ev’n a God can give, 25
He freely offer’d tothe num’rous throng,
That on his lips with lift’ning pleasure hung.

"Take him, ye wretched, for your only good,
"Take him ye starving sinners, for your food;
"Ye thirsty, come to this life-giving stream, 3o
"Ye preachers, take him for your joyful theme;
"Take him my dear Americans, he said,
"Be your complaints on his kind bosom laid:
“Take him, ye Africans, he longs for You,
“Impartial Saviour is his title due: 35
"Wash’d in the fountain of redeeming blood,
"You shall be sons, and kings, and priests to God.”
