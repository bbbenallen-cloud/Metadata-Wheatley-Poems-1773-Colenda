18 POEMS ON

On being brought from AFRICA to
AMERICA.

'TWAS mercy brought me from my Pagan
land,
Taught my benighted foul to understand

That there’s a God, that there’s a Saviour too:
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die.”
Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain,
May be refin’d, and join th’ angelic train.
